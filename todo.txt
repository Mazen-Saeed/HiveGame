1- Update comments and docstrings.
2- Handle actual full-game logic (maybe, this might be up to GUI?).
3- optimise maybe. Everything in rules (piece.py, cell_position.py, game_state.py) is currently brute-forced.
4- anything that loops over all cells should be optimised to only loop on placed pieces of a player.
